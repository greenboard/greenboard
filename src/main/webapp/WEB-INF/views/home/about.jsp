		<h2>The Greenboard Project</h2>
	   	
	   	This project aims to build software to help communities share interesting events; in essence, it is inspired by the use of village boards, located in the heart of small rural communities, to share interesting events and information that may be of use to residents.
	 
		At the current time, our main goal is to combine a number of methodologies we believe in with a number of technologies/architectural concepts that are a good fit for the application.  
	
		Our initial motivations are technology and design driven; we want Greenboard to become a demonstration of the techniques we believe in, hence becoming a playground to learn and apply exciting new approaches, and more importantly, to develop something that may be useful to people :)
